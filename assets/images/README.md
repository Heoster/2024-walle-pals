# Assets Directory

This directory is prepared for future image integration. The website is currently designed with CSS-generated visuals and placeholders that can be easily replaced with actual images.

## Structure
- `images/` - For photos, graphics, and visual content
- Future subdirectories can be added as needed

## Image Integration
When adding images:
1. Replace placeholder divs with `<img>` tags
2. Update CSS to accommodate actual image dimensions
3. Implement lazy loading for performance
4. Ensure responsive image handling

## Supported Formats
- JPEG/JPG for photos
- PNG for graphics with transparency
- WebP for modern browsers (with fallbacks)
- SVG for icons and simple graphics

The current design maintains visual appeal without requiring images, using gradients, CSS shapes, and animations instead.
